# Cyber Movies

This apps is HUGE, and it was pretty fun to make. It's whole purpose its to serve as a centralized source of information about movies, new movies, top rated movies, etc. 

It works both for searching movies or to see the details of an specific one. 

It also adds a favorite functionality that allows you to save your favorite movies into the browser storage.

It uses a few technologies like, Material UI and React Router, anything else was built from scratch.
